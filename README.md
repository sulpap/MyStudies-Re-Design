# MyStudies-re-design
The implementation of the redesign of MyStudies (mystudies.uoa.gr), a website for students, professors and the secretariat of the University of Athens, in order to better serve the needs of its users, as a project in Human-Computer Interaction (7th semester course). In this website, the students can view their curriculum, register in courses, preview their grades and request for certificates from the secretariat. The professors, by their part, can assign grades, view and edit the courses they teach.

The evaluation of the original website and the implementation of the new one have been completed taking into account Nielsen's 10 usability principles.

The project was built using **React v20.10.0** and is explained in this pdf: [ReadMe.pdf](https://github.com/Vicky-Christofilopoulou/MyStudies-re-design/files/14550704/ReadMe.pdf)
